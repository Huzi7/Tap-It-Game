So I have been developing a brand new mobile game since the last 2 days. The game is called Tap It, and it's designed for mobile. You can play also play with your PC. In the game you need to listen or look at the instructions on screen, and follow them.(E.G. Swipe Up)
You lose if you don't react in time or if you do the wrong action. I will hopefully post more updates to keep you guys updated.
